Deep Sketch-Based 3D Modeling (DS-3DM) explores how human sketches can be translated into rich 3D representations using modern AI techniques. This work introduces **MORPHEUS**, a structured design space that organizes DS-3DM methods around an **Input–Model–Output** framework, highlighting trends, limitations, and opportunities for user-centered 3D modeling.

## Main Papers

We have compiled a chronological list of the primary papers referenced in this survey, presented in a format designed to facilitate long-term maintenance by the community.
